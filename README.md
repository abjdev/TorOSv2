## EtorumOS basics
EtorumOS uses a CLI to accept commands. It also has an user account system (UAS). The CLI interprets a very basic language called EtoScript - it only features string parsing and executing (multiple) commands and this will probably stay like that. Commands that you can are, for example, `cd, ls, read, setpassword, cedit` and more!

#### CEdit (CommandEdit)
CEdit is an editor that is controlled by using commands. And I am gonna be honest, I just failed at implementing a proper editor lol  
CEdit has a `help` command that shows you all commands available. CEdit itself also interprets ETOScript but it **only** includes CEdit commands.

#### Path limitations
As of now, only navigating using `cd` supports the .. "operator" to go back a folder. A proper path parsing implementation will be added soon.

#### User folder & autorun.etos
After logging in for the first time, you will be in your user folder by default. (`0:\users\<username\`)  
This folder only has one default file called autorun.etos, this file can contain any ETOScript that will execute as soon as you log in.

#### UserAccountService (UAS)
The UAS manages all users. You can use the `um <new/delete/logout>` command to manage the users in your installation.
